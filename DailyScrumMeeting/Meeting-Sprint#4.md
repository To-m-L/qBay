## Team Member: Briggs Fisher
<h4>Q1:</h4>
The branch Briggs worked on was branch_Tom where all work for the update product was done in newly added update product files to avoid merge conflicts.
<h4>Q2:</h4> 
Test cases were written for R5-2 using input partitioning testing where input was partitioned into
increased price and decreased price, and a test case was written for R5-1 using input partitioning testing
where the input was partitioned into updating attributes that are the attributes of owner_email or last_modified date, and updating the attributes that arenâ€™t owner_email or last_modified date.
<h4>Q3:</h4> 
Tests for update product relied on a product being created beforehand and the product created beforehand must be a valid product attached to a logged in user
<h4>Q4:</h4>
Briggs will finish the last two tests of the update product within the last two days and he plans to finish R5-3 on Thursday and R5-4 on Friday.

## Team Member: Tom Lin
<h4>Q1:</h4>
Tom was working in the branch_Tom branch
<h4>Q2:</h4> 
Tom completed two tests, R4-3 and R4-5. They were both tested using Input Partitioning with Input Boundary Testing
<h4>Q3:</h4> 
The user must be registered and logged in before they can create products, and I was not able to test my tests unless a user was already registered.
<h4>Q4:</h4>
Tom's plan is to complete all of the tests by friday afternoon at the latest
